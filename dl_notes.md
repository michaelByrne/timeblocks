belief nets
'fooling' discriminator


research

- controlling features in gen model
- 'plug and play' generative networks
- stack GAN

generative intelligence: 
	'imagining possible futures'
	simulation

'data as its own supervision'
	context as supervision

'semantic photoshop'

shivon zilis - lying about deep learning (hype)


in place computing - 
	associative processing unit
	beating memory bottleneck by doing computation in memory
	neighborood computing (shifting)


mapping specification for mapping model to processors - baidu
	- almost intractable problem



deep robotic learning - data problem
	learning to grasp soft objects weirdly
	to learn collisions, you have to collide with stuff ("hopeless")
		safe "uncertainty aware" learning

machine learning for sustainability 
	predicting poverty


machine learning turbulence forecasts

nvidia dude:
	pascal gp100


svd - word correlation example
	

stacey yahoo - emoji
